# Sorus-Launcher
This code was rushed as it is not final, if anyone is interested in committing I am completely open.

## Setting up project
Setting up is easy, you just need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [ElectronJS](https://www.electronjs.org/) installed.<br>
After that, download / clone the repository. <br>
Once you have unzipped it, open your terminal (or integrated terminal on vscode) and run: `npm i`. This will install all the dependencies which the project requires<br>

## Running the project
After you made some changes open your terminal and run: `npm start`. This will start it in a development environment

## Building the project
Currently, I have only made a Build script for Windows. Feel free to try build for linux and macos!<br>
To build do: `npm run dist`

## Compatibility
You can use a [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to generate a table
